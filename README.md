========================

My works are generally  open source and free software with a bit of a proprietary slant to them, Not sure why that's just how it is, Most of the paid software involved are covered under the Apache 2.0 Licence thus are not to totally off limits. Beside the parties involved are already well familiar with my stuff. But I caution if your a purist you might want to steer clear. I've already got the build, I just need to licence the works and make them more widely available, overall I'm please with what I have at present.
